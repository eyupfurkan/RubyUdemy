so fight cuz this is a rails project and if I go to the controllers and go to loads why not  so you can see there's tons of these instance variables right then don't  worry about this part of it this is getting stuff from the database okay but these instance variables are basically temporary storage for what it's grabbing so I've taken all the the loads from the database and !'ve put it in this instance variable for the index page of this particular section of the app and I'm calling it all  loads now if I go to the views and I go to loads and I go to index you can see here that I've got this loads here search loads and if we look at the at that loads controller file you can see they're defined in the index search  loads loads all loads so I'm actually  not pulling this in I'm actually  getting the loads here  and then I'm setting this to another instance variable here saying search loads Eagles all loads search params so don't  worry about what we're doing here just understand that  basically I've created these instance variables and you can call them anytime there's an instance alright so that's how that works  search loads are on and on and on and on I hope that's not too confusing I hope when we come back and we start working with this stuff it's going to get a little clearer for you but I couldn't think of another way to really show you how these instance variables work so that's how they work. OK we'll be right back
